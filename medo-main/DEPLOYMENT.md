# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## Netlify Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment on Netlify.

### 🔧 Configuration Files

1. **`netlify.toml`** (root directory)
   - Build command: `cd 'one part/my-protofile-main/project' && npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `one part/my-protofile-main/project/dist`
   - Node version: 18

2. **`_redirects`** (in public folder)
   - Handles React Router SPA routing
   - All routes redirect to index.html

### 📋 Build Process

The build process includes:
- Installing dependencies
- Building the React app with Vite
- Optimizing assets and code splitting
- Copying static files to dist/

### 🚀 Quick Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically**:
   - Detect the push
   - Run the build command
   - Deploy to your domain

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't work:

1. **Check Netlify build logs** for errors
2. **Verify build command** is correct
3. **Ensure publish directory** exists
